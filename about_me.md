I'm a 27 year old half-Japanese guy from Brisbane, Australia. I have a secret burning passion for cooking and trying (and making) different cuisines around the world. Recently, I travelled to Vietnam with my amazing Vietnamese girlfriend and got introduced to the true Vietnamese cuisine hidden away from the rest of the world. I've had the pleasure of visiting the country twice already---to both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City---but there were just so many amazing dishes I wanted to talk about so I decided to start a blog about it. I will be gradually updating this blog whenever I find time to introduce everyone to the amazing dishes I came across during my travels.
