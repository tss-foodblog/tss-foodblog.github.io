### How many Vietnamese dishes can you name, apart from Phở, rice paper roll, and Bánh mì?

For a long time, I thought that those dishes were all what's Vietnamese food was about, because outside of Vietnam, these are the only dishes which became widespread in the world today. Especially phở has been getting a lot of attention recently, and is becoming a new craze (although I am a great fan of it and it's what got me into Vietnamese food in the first place). But these dishes really only scrape the surface of Vietnamese cuisine, and in reality, there is so much more than just these which you see on the street everyday. My girlfriend, who is a local from Ho Chi Minh City, after spending a long time abroad---missing her local food very much---once went without having phở for three months! In this blog, I aim to provide a window into the deep and fascinating world of Vietnamese food, filled with spices, vegetables, meat and magic!

### How are dishes named in Vietnam?
Have you ever wondered went to a Vietnamese restaurant and wondered what _phở tái_, _phở đặc biệt_ or _bánh mì_ actually means? Or was confused by the difference between _phở tái_ and _phở bò_? Well it's actually quite simple! Most Vietnamese dishes are just named from a combination their main ingredients: for example, _phở bò_ just comes from _phở_, which is a word for a type of flat, thick rice noodle, and _bò_, which is the word for beef. The word after _phở_ changes with what's added to the noodle (soup), where _tái_ is used for the thinly sliced raw beef, and _đặc biệt_ literally means 'special' but 'combination' in context. 

### Just a bit about myself
I'm a 27 year old half-Japanese guy from Brisbane, Australia. I have a secret burning passion for cooking and trying (and making) different cuisines around the world. Recently, I travelled to Vietnam with my amazing Vietnamese girlfriend and got introduced to the true Vietnamese cuisine hidden away from the rest of the world. I've had the pleasure of visiting the country twice already---to both Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City---but there were just so many amazing dishes I wanted to talk about so I decided to start a blog about it. I will be gradually updating this blog whenever I find time to introduce everyone to the amazing dishes I came across during my travels.
